Description: Smooth tests are data driven (alternative hypothesis is dynamically selected based on data). 
    In this package you will find two groups of smooth of test: goodness-of-fit tests and
    nonparametric tests for comparing distributions.
    Among goodness-of-fit tests there are tests for exponent, Gaussian, Gumbel 
    and uniform distribution.
    Among nonparametric tests there are tests for stochastic dominance,
    k-sample test, test with umbrella alternatives and test for change-point problems.
    Find a detailed description for these tests at TODO.
