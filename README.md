`ddst` stands for Data Driven Smooth Tests, these are tests in which alternative hypothesis is dynamically selected based on data.

In this package you will find two groups of smooth of test: goodness-of-fit tests and
    nonparametric tests for comparing distributions.
    
Among goodness-of-fit tests there are tests for exponent, Gaussian, Gumbel 
    and uniform distribution.
    
Among nonparametric tests there are tests for stochastic dominance,
    k-sample test, test with umbrella alternatives and test for change-point problems.




Find a detailed description for these tests at http://www.biecek.pl/R/ddst/description.pdf (TODO: update).
